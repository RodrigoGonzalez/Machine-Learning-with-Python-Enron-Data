# Machine-Learning-with-Python-Enron-Data
As part of Udacity's Data Analysis Nano Degree (DAND), and using Python, basically scikit-learn, I had to build a classification algorithm to identify Enron employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset. I experimented with several preprocessing, feature selection, and classification algorithms and implemented a pipeline with grid search to reach the final best result.
